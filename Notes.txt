when program starts do these things in order:
1. create ships (structs: name, health: 2-5, pos: coordinates[], side: player or bot)
2. bot randomly places ships on board coordinates
3. Display board
4. player places ships on coordinates (one by one)
5. player chooses location of BOT ships
6. BOT makes a randomized guess using randomizer
7. back and forth until someone wins

Requirements:
- Track ship health somehow
  - for both bot and player ships
- Track ship locations for both teams
- implement a randomizer the bot can call
- error handling
  - nobody can guess same coordinate twice
- how do we create a dynamic board?
